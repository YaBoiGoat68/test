        <p><strong>The </strong>FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.
          The 20-meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start.
          The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal.
          A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound.
          Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible.
          The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.
          The test will begin on the word start.
